# Rock-Paper-Scissors Game (rock_paper_scissors)

## Overview

This Python project is a simple implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Users play against the computer by choosing between rock ('r'), paper ('p'), or scissors ('s'). The computer's choice is randomly generated, and the winner is determined based on the game rules.

## Functions

### `play()`

Allows the user to play a round of Rock-Paper-Scissors against the computer. The user inputs their choice ('r', 'p', or 's'), and the computer randomly selects one. The winner is then determined and displayed on the console.

## Usage

1. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python your_script_name.py
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Enter 'r' for rock, 'p' for paper, or 's' for scissors.

The computer randomly chooses its move, and the winner of the round is determined and displayed.

Repeat as desired to play multiple rounds.

Notes
The game follows the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors rules: rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock.
Customization
You can modify the play function to add more features or customize the gameplay.
Consider implementing a scoring system or additional game variations.
